I expected nothing less from this spin-off about the nun who appears in The Conjuring 2. It provides some answers at the end, which are revealed if you go and see the movie.",

Although, it's an hour and a half long, but that hour and a half is one scare after another… But the good thing about the scares is that they keep you from falling asleep halfway through and keep you engaged in the story. In short, in my opinion, The Nun is a good movie.",
